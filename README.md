# Compressor: Open Source Compound Bow Press
⚠️ **Under construction - CAD files are mature but documentation is still WIP** ⚠️
![Assembly](/Images/assembly.png)

Compressor is a low-cost, highly capable open-source bow press designed to be constructed from commonly available steel and aluminium stock. 
## Features:
- Capable of pressing bows up to 42" AtA.
- Draw board with lock for handsfree use.
- Accommodates split limb bows with a limb gap of more than 12mm (not compatible with past-parallel limbs).
- Parts cost of approximately £250-300.
- No welding required - built entirely using common hand tools.
- Only two custom-made parts - everything else is fabricated from common stock sizes.

## Bill of Materials
⚠️ This list may not be perfect - it is recommended to order a few extra fasteners just in case.

STL is available [here](/Manufacturing%20files/Rotating_handle.stl). If buying them, ensure at the thread length is at least 10mm.   	|

### Raw Materials
#### Steel
Steel box sections formed by extrusion often have a seam that protrudes into the inside of the tube, and is impossible to remove without specialised tools. Check with your supplier that this seam is not so prominent that the 50mm square section cannot comfortably fit inside of the 60mm section otherwise you **will not be able to assemble the press**.

### Custom Manufactured Parts
These are the only parts of the project that need to be custom-made. Various CNC and waterjet companies are available - if you shop around you should be able to get them made for approximately £100. I have had good experiences with Xometry. A referral link to sign up is available [here](https://get.xometry.uk/r/0f2031980c). DXF / STEP files are available in [Manufacturing files](/Manufacturing%20files).
